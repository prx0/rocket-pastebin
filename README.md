# Rocket pastebin
Based on https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/pastebin/

- [x] Add a web form to the index where users can manually input new pastes. Accept the form at POST /. Use format and/or rank to specify which of the two POST /routes should be called.
- [x] Support deletion of pastes by adding a new DELETE /<id> route. Use PasteId to validate <id>.
- [ ] Indicate partial uploads with a 206 partial status code. If the user uploads a paste that meets or exceeds the allowed limit, return a 206 partial statuscode. Otherwise, return a 201 created status code.
- [x] Set the Content-Type of the return value in upload and retrieve to text/plain.
- [x] Return a unique "key" after each upload and require that the key is present and matches when doing deletion. Use one of Rocket's core traits to do the keyvalidation.
- [x] Add a PUT /<id> route that allows a user with the key for <id> to replace the existing paste, if any.
- [x] Add a new route, GET /<id>/<lang> that syntax highlights the paste with ID <id> for language <lang>. If <lang> is not a known language, do no highlighting. Possibly validate <lang> with FromParam.
- [x] Use the local module to write unit tests for your pastebin.
- [x] Dispatch a thread before launching Rocket in main that periodically cleans up idling old pastes in upload/.
